Here is a description of each Python program, its respective file name, and its intended purpose.

Hello World.py – The intended purpose of this program is simply to print the message “Hello World” to the screen

Name Greeting.py - This program prompts the user to enter their name and it will then greet them with their name as a response and displays it to the screen.

Name and Instructor Greeting.py - This program prompts the user for their name and then it prompts the instructor for their name and then displays a nice greeting to both user and instructor to the screen. *(I’ve also included a variation of the code for this program called “Name Instructor Greeting2.py - This program requests input of username and the first name of the instructor. It is strict in who it responds to since the variables that are assigned to the objects are very specific. You can modify the variables with other specific names however, each statement must correspond with the specific names assigned. All other names will not be recognized by the program.)

Area of circle.py – This program will take the input from a user in the form of “r” which = radius. The formula  A=πr^2 will compute the area of a circle and displays the results to the screen

Car MPG.py - This program takes the input in miles driven from a user, then it takes input for the number of gallons of gas used and then calculates the car's miles per gallon rating and displays it to the screen. In this scenario, I used type converter “float” in order to change an integer into a floating-point number which would accept decimal numbers in order to give the user the accuracy needed in inputting their mileage. Converting miles per gallon is as simple as dividing the number of miles, with the number of gallons of gas used.

Celsius to Fahrenheit.py - This program requests the input of the temperature in degrees in Fahrenheit, and then it converts it into degrees in Celsius. It is important to note that I used type converter “float” in order to change an integer into a floating-point number which would accept decimal numbers in order to give the user the added accuracy needed in inputting their temperature.

Starting day number.py - In this program, a user is requested to enter the day of the week for days representing the following values.
0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, 3 = Wednesday, 4 = Thursday, 5 = Friday, 6 = Saturday.
The variable end_day calculates (start_day + days_to_wait). % 7 represents a modulus of 7 days in a one-week period. So, if you left on Wednesday, and returned 10 days later on a Saturday, then Saturday is representative of the 6th day of the week.
